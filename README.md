## Notice 
If you want to run each code, please read README in src/.

## Homework 1: Cadence Innovus P&R tool
Use Cadence Innovus to complete the P&R(Place and Route) flow for a given synthesized standard-cell design.

## Homework 2: Two-way Min-cut Partitioning
Implement Fiduccia¡VMattheyses(FM) algorithm to solve the problem of two-way min-cut partitioning.

## Homework 3: Fixed-outline Slicing Floorplan Design
Implement Stockmeyer algorithm to solve the fixed-outline floorplan design with a set of hard blocks.

## Homework 4: Placement Legalization
Implement an existing algorithm, called ¡§Abacus¡¨, to legalize a given global placement result with minimal total displacement.

## Homework 5: Automated P&R for Analog Circuits
Write a program to place and route some analog circuits and need to output the results in the DEF(Design Exchange File) format. Visualize the DEF by Cadence Virtuoso.
